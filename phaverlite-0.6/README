PHAVerLite (PHAVer + PPLite) is a variant of PHAVer, a formal verification
tool for computing reachability of hybrid systems. The main difference with
respect to PHAVer, originally developed by Goran Frehse and later included
in the SpaceEx platform, is the replacement of PPL (Parma Polyhedra Library)
with PPLite. PHAVerLite currently provides a subset of the functionalities
offered by PHAVer.

PHAVerLite has been developed on a Linux distribution.
In order to build it from sources, the following are needed:
 - a C++ compiler (g++, clang++) supporting the 2017 standard
   (starting from version 0.5; previous versions based on C++ 2011);
 - flex and bison (recent versions);
 - GMP, GNU MPFR and FLINT libraries (recent versions);
 - the PPLite library (github.com/ezaffanella/PPLite);
   each version of PHAVerLite is based on a specific version of PPLite
   (e.g., 0.6 is based on PPLite 0.10.2).

The usual build procedure (configure + make) generates:
 - a dynamically linked executable (phaverlite);
 - a statically linked executable (phaverlite_static).
Note that you may need to feed `configure' with a few options to let it
figure out where the required libraries are located in your system.

Note: PHAVerLite is a stand-alone tool; it cannot be used (as is) as a
plugin for the SpaceEx platform. It can deal with hybrid automata
specified using a subset of PHAVer's syntax
(see http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~frehse/phaver_web/phaver_lang.pdf).
Note that the original syntax of PHAVer has been subject to a few
changes, most of which are summarized here below.

* PHAVer's keywords do, end, goto, sync, wait are treated as identifiers
  in PHAVerLite; hence, they can be used as location names and/or
  syncronization label names without causing a syntax error.
* Parameter USE_CONVEX_HULL has been renamed to REACH_USE_CONVEX_HULL.
* Added parameter REACH_USE_CONSTRAINT_HULL.
* Parameter CHEAP_CONTAIN_RETURN_OTHERS has been renamed to
  REACH_CHEAP_CONTAINS.
* Added parameter REACH_CHEAP_CONTAINS_USE_BBOX.
* Parameter ELAPSE_TIME has been renamed to REACH_USE_TIME_ELAPSE.
* Parameter SEARCH_METHOD has been changed to only accept 3 values
  (rather than the 8 values accepted by PHAVer):
   - value 0: transaction based (was value 0 in PHAVer);
   - value 1: topological sort of all states (was value 7 in PHAVer);
   - value 2: topological sort of reachable states (was value 6 in PHAVer);
     this is the value used by default.
* Parameter REACH_ONLY_EXPLORE has been removed.
* Parameter REFINE_LOCATION_PLANE has been removed.
* All parameters related to simulation checking have been removed
  (as simulation checking is no longer supported).
